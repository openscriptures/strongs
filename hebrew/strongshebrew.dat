For a hundred years Strong's Dictionaries have been popular with Bible students.
By assigning numbers to each unique word in the Old and New Testaments and
listing each word with its number, Strong produced a standard, still used today,
for referencing definitions. Bible students, with little or no knowledge of
Greek and Hebrew, are able to use Strong's numbers to learn about the Greek and
Hebrew of the Bible.

ASCII e-text version:
=====================

The files for this e-text were produced by Michael Grier, mgrier@pdnt.com,
in 1996, and download from  http://members.tripod.com/~SoftIdeas, in
February 1998. The files have been setup for importing into the Online
Bible for DOS. But to make these files into generic text files, all that
is needed is to replace the terms "GREEK" and "HEBREW" with "Greek" and
"Hebrew" or the names of the appropriate files. 

The e-text has been changed from the printed version in three ways.

1) A five digit Strong's word number with leading zeros has been placed before
   each entry. 
2) Where Strong provides the number of another word for etymology,
   a line with "see GREEK for" or "see HEBREW for" and the number, has been
   added after Strong's entry for the word. (This is for use after
   importing into the DOS version of Online Bible, but also provides a good
   way to programmatically add links.)
3) The abbreviations used by Strong in the
   Greek dictionary, (not Hebrew) have been replaced by the abbreviated words.

Michael Grier did a check of the e-text against a printed Strong's dictionary.
The work seems clean but more proofreading is needed to certify it clean from
errors.

Corrected edition:
==================

The initial edition of this e-text requested errors to be reported to Bible
Foundation. However, "Bible Foundation had to quit maintaining the e-text files
but they live on and many people around the world have been greatly blessed."

Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen <http://www.hum.aau.dk/~ulrikp/> and Weston Ruter
<http://weston.ruter.net/> noticed several typos and errors in the
text. Ulrik revised the Greek text and released another edition in XML including
Unicode Greek, BETA code, and transliterations. Weston revised the e-texts
as part of an effort to make a new unified XML document consisting of both the Greek
and Hebrew entries. More information is available at http://openscriptures.org/

The initial Greek and Hebrew e-texts used for this corrected edition was downloaded
from the SWORD project in December 2008:
 - http://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModInfo.jsp?modName=StrongsGreek
 - http://www.crosswire.org/sword/modules/ModInfo.jsp?modName=StrongsHebrew
Both of these modules were versioned at 1.2 and dated 2002-01-01. The
incorporated revised Greek text by Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen was versioned at 1.4
and dated 2007-09-14 and was downloaded from the MorphGNT project:
